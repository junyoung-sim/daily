Solved 230+ coding problems (mostly from Baekjoon) related to essential algortihmic topics, such as data structures, brute force, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, FT, greedy algorithm, number theory, prefix sum, sorting, and more. The following are some of my favorite problems so far.

[1067](./baekjoon/fft/1067.cpp) Use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to find the maximum convolution of two arrays that can be circulated. This problem took a lot of time and effort as I had to learn about Taylor/Maclaurin Series and Euler's Formula to understand FFT and its use in performing convolutions.

[1725](./baekjoon/divideconquer/1725.cpp) Find the maximum rectangle area of a given histogram. I learned about segment trees for efficient range minimum query to solve this problem, though stacks and basic brute force may be used.

[11444](./baekjoon/divideconquer/11444.cpp) Compute fibonacci numbers using matrix exponentiation. It was eye-opening to learn that matrix exponentiation could be faster than a simple N-time computation.

[2580](./baekjoon/brute/2580.cpp) Brute force through a sudoku puzzle. As a sudoku lover, this problem naturally became a favorite.

[11054](./baekjoon/dp/11054.cpp) Find the longest bitonic sequence using dynamic programming. I just love DP. It's elegant.

[25682](./baekjoon/prefixsum/25682.cpp) Use prefix summation to find the least number of cells that need editing on a K x K chess board within a larger N x M chess board. Great example of "work smart, not hard."

[1309](./baekjoon/dp/1309.cpp) Use dynamic programming to find the number of possibilities of sheltering lions in a zoo given that they cannot be placed right next to each other. This is one of the first DP problems that taught me how to think about finding patterns and writing them into elegant code.

[2156](./baekjoon/dp/2156.cpp) Another dynamic programming problem for maximizing the amount of wine that can be consumed given that one cannot drink three cups in a row. Similar learning experience as the problem above.

[14888](./baekjoon/brute/14888.cpp) Find the maximum and minimum value of a equation given the number and type of operators can be added. Fun backtracking problem.
